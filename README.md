# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction

# ðŸ“Š Customer Survival Analysis for Telecom Churn

This project implements a real-world **customer survival prediction system** using **Kaplan-Meier Estimator**, **Cox Proportional Hazards Model**, and **Random Forest Classifier** on a telecom dataset to estimate **how long a customer will stay before churning**.

---

## Problem Statement

Telecom companies lose millions annually due to customer churn. Traditional classification models only predict **if** a customer will churn â€” but businesses need to know:

> **"When is a customer likely to churn?"**

This project answers that using **Survival Analysis** to predict **time-to-churn** and drive proactive retention strategies.

##  Techniques Used

### 1. **Kaplan-Meier Estimator**
- Visualizes survival probability over time.
- Non-parametric, good for cohort comparisons.

### 2. **Cox Proportional Hazards Model**
- Semi-parametric regression model.
- Estimates **hazard ratios** for features affecting churn risk.
- Helps understand **which features increase/decrease risk over time**.

### 3. **Random Forest Classifier**
- Determines **feature importance** for churn prediction.
- Used for **classification-based evaluation** and performance comparison.

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics

| Metric            | Purpose                                              |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Concordance Index (C-index)** | Measures how well the Cox model ranks risks |
| **ROC AUC Score** | Evaluates classification performance of Random Forest |
| **P-values**      | Tests statistical significance of each feature       |
| **Hazard Ratios** | Interprets relative risk contributed by features     |
